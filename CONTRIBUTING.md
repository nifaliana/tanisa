# Welcome to Tanisa 🇲🇬

Hey there,
Thanks for stopping by!
Whether you're here to squash bugs, sprinkle in new features, or just correct that one typo that's been bugging you — you're awesome and we appreciate you.

This guide is your magic scroll to contributing like a pro. Please read it before opening issues or sending pull requests. It helps us help _you_ help _us_.

## 🐛 Bug Reports & 🧠 Feature Ideas

Found a bug? Got a genius idea at 2AM? We want to hear it!  
Pop it into the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nifaliana/tanisa/issues) — but first:

Check if someone else already reported it.  
Include:

- How to make the bug appear (step-by-step wizardry)
- Your Tanisa version
- Any tweaks you made (we don’t judge)

## 🤝 Pull Requests

Pull requests are like party invites — we’re thrilled to receive them. Before you crash the repo with your awesome code:

1. Work from the latest **main** branch.
2. Check if someone already fixed that issue.
3. For big stuff, open an issue first so we can cheer you on.

**To contribute**:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Make your changes — focus, grasshopper.
3. Pass all local tests, pre-commits and pre-push (Tanisa is picky).
4. Write meaningful and [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) messages (not just “fix stuff” 😅).
5. Open that pull request.
6. Watch the CI like a hawk — fix if it fails.
7. Stick around for feedback, high fives, or emoji reactions.
